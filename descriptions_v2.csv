Description
"This company is an e-retailer with a unique method for collecting books. It combined this strategy with the development of simple software that only analyzes current market information. This has created efficiencies in the pricing and processing of books. We are looking to build off of this initial software by starting Price Point. Its goal is to create predictive pricing models using historical data and machine learning. Additionally, once the item is â€œliveâ€ there is a need to keep the listing competitive in a dynamic marketplace. We hope to apply this new technology to our current operations and to initially market it as a pricing engine for third-party sellers on Amazon.

"Python Data Scientist - Research and Engineering
BACKGROUND
MAX Insurance is a 160-year-old Property & Casualty insurance company, that provides Home, Farm, Commercial, and Auto insurance. The company was acquired by Chelsea Avondale in 2016, with a plan to technologically modernize its operations and transform its pricing with advanced scientific methodologies.
Chelsea Avondale acquired Max Insurance in 2016. Chelsea Avondaleâ€™s team consists of former Canadian bank executives/industry veterans, that have a background in scientific computing and the development of full-scale production-level systems.
Skynet Software is a sister company to Max Insurance & Chelsea Avondale that employs the team of scientists, research & engineering, and systems development staff that serves the overall group.
The objective for Max Insurance since being acquired by Chelsea Avondale is to â€œwipe cleanâ€ all systems of the company, and â€œstart freshâ€ in the development of the Core Systems of an insurance company. This is a significant undertaking and a luxury most existing insurance companies don't have. The group is well underway in this process and is looking to add smart and brilliant physical and mathematical scientists, data and computer scientists to its team.
In practice, this complete redevelopment means the re-engineering of almost everything: every function and every interaction with the core systems of an insurance company. The Skynet Software team has been established to handle this responsibility.
The office is located in Kitchener, Ontario.
JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS
We are a Python Shop. You must know Python cold, and not as a simple recreational tool that you have experimented with. In addtion, you must know Pandas extraordinarily well: working with large datasets terabytes in size, developing customized functions, knowing how to speed up computation, etc.
The role involves much more than just Data Science. The development of our risk analytics ecosystem involves scientific modeling of natural hazards, curating risk data warehouses, systems engineering, data engineering, the development of DL/ML/AI middleware, and the guidance and oversight of front-end people. Less than 50% of this role involves data science. In particular, you must have a knack for building stochastic models for catastrophic events (e.g. wildfires, windstorm & climate, floods, etc.).
You are multi-talented with a deep intellectual curiosity. We are looking for scientific developers with a desire to immerse themselves in both software engineering, data science and mathematical modelling. The ideal candidate works quickly, independently and meticulously. You will have to think creatively to find the best solution for each problem in a limited time.
We are a NoSQL Shop.You must understand MongoDB or be able to learn it at an expert level quickly.
TensorFlow/Keras is a major asset.You have dealt with large numeric datasetsand can build fast analytics tools with the GPU. 10 million rows by 300 columns is a no-brainer for you.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN FROM US:
The insurance business: Policies/Coverages/Claims, risk analysis, advanced modelling, all core systems to run an insurance company.
Risk modelling: Catastrophes, probabilistic risk analysis, application of ML/DL to the insurance world, including the redevelopment of most Actuarial scientific methods.
Software Engineering: The design, development in Python, and deployment of an entire scientific software engineering project to run an entire insurance company. Being involved in the combination of a backend/middleware/front-end rooted in risk modelling with ML/DL.
Become a World Class Talent: You will work with Actuaries, Catastrophe Modeling experts, ML/DL specialists, and Software/Systems Engineers, and many leaders in the business. Depending on your skills, aptitude and leadership capabilities you will build a team or advance to executive roles.
Further information on our Ecosystem Stack:
BACKEND
MongoDB for NoSQL backend.
ELTs used for Aggregations/Layering/Transformations via Map/Reduce etc. to create Risk Data Warehouses as well as Transactional Data Structures (â€œData Warehouses or DWsâ€).
DWs will be stored in PyTables HDF5 files for highspeed. Eventually move to Hadoop based file structures. Understanding of the drag of dealing with large datasets will be essential.
Numerous APIs for external data sourcing, as well as static data ingestion through Geospatial KML files / SQL databases / JSON records.
MIDDLEWARE
Python Pandas / Dask is our primary framework for almost all engineering.
Use of â€œinternal APIsâ€ to create ecosystem modules and multiprocessing â€” > via PyZMQ
TensorFlow / Keras for GPU processing, and all DL/ML/AI to determine classification/clustering
Data visualization in matplotlib. Very advanced knowledge of customization is helpful (i.e. build your own Seaborn)
FRONT-END
Django web service at full scale. API centric to make front-ends quite naive and removing most logic from front-ends
We will hire a number of front-end engineers to build light-weight UIs in HTML/CSS/JS, mobile, APIs
Chatbots / NLP will be built to handle transaction ingestion, to further minimize the logic in front-ends
Educational Background Requirements
MSc/PhD required.

"Python Data Scientist - Research and Engineering
BACKGROUND
MAX Insurance is a 160-year-old Property & Casualty insurance company, that provides Home, Farm, Commercial, and Auto insurance. The company was acquired by Chelsea Avondale in 2016, with a plan to technologically modernize its operations and transform its pricing with advanced scientific methodologies.
Chelsea Avondale acquired Max Insurance in 2016. Chelsea Avondaleâ€™s team consists of former Canadian bank executives/industry veterans, that have a background in scientific computing and the development of full-scale production-level systems.
Skynet Software is a sister company to Max Insurance & Chelsea Avondale that employs the team of scientists, research & engineering, and systems development staff that serves the overall group.
The objective for Max Insurance since being acquired by Chelsea Avondale is to â€œwipe cleanâ€ all systems of the company, and â€œstart freshâ€ in the development of the Core Systems of an insurance company. This is a significant undertaking and a luxury most existing insurance companies don't have. The group is well underway in this process and is looking to add smart and brilliant physical and mathematical scientists, data and computer scientists to its team.
In practice, this complete redevelopment means the re-engineering of almost everything: every function and every interaction with the core systems of an insurance company. The Skynet Software team has been established to handle this responsibility.
The office is located in Kitchener, Ontario.
JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS
We are a Python Shop. You must know Python cold, and not as a simple recreational tool that you have experimented with. In addtion, you must know Pandas extraordinarily well: working with large datasets terabytes in size, developing customized functions, knowing how to speed up computation, etc.
The role involves much more than just Data Science. The development of our risk analytics ecosystem involves scientific modeling of natural hazards, curating risk data warehouses, systems engineering, data engineering, the development of DL/ML/AI middleware, and the guidance and oversight of front-end people. Less than 50% of this role involves data science. In particular, you must have a knack for building stochastic models for catastrophic events (e.g. wildfires, windstorm & climate, floods, etc.).
You are multi-talented with a deep intellectual curiosity. We are looking for scientific developers with a desire to immerse themselves in both software engineering, data science and mathematical modelling. The ideal candidate works quickly, independently and meticulously. You will have to think creatively to find the best solution for each problem in a limited time.
We are a NoSQL Shop.You must understand MongoDB or be able to learn it at an expert level quickly.
TensorFlow/Keras is a major asset.You have dealt with large numeric datasetsand can build fast analytics tools with the GPU. 10 million rows by 300 columns is a no-brainer for you.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN FROM US:
The insurance business: Policies/Coverages/Claims, risk analysis, advanced modelling, all core systems to run an insurance company.
Risk modelling: Catastrophes, probabilistic risk analysis, application of ML/DL to the insurance world, including the redevelopment of most Actuarial scientific methods.
Software Engineering: The design, development in Python, and deployment of an entire scientific software engineering project to run an entire insurance company. Being involved in the combination of a backend/middleware/front-end rooted in risk modelling with ML/DL.
Become a World Class Talent: You will work with Actuaries, Catastrophe Modeling experts, ML/DL specialists, and Software/Systems Engineers, and many leaders in the business. Depending on your skills, aptitude and leadership capabilities you will build a team or advance to executive roles.
Further information on our Ecosystem Stack:
BACKEND
MongoDB for NoSQL backend.
ELTs used for Aggregations/Layering/Transformations via Map/Reduce etc. to create Risk Data Warehouses as well as Transactional Data Structures (â€œData Warehouses or DWsâ€).
DWs will be stored in PyTables HDF5 files for highspeed. Eventually move to Hadoop based file structures. Understanding of the drag of dealing with large datasets will be essential.
Numerous APIs for external data sourcing, as well as static data ingestion through Geospatial KML files / SQL databases / JSON records.
MIDDLEWARE
Python Pandas / Dask is our primary framework for almost all engineering.
Use of â€œinternal APIsâ€ to create ecosystem modules and multiprocessing â€” > via PyZMQ
TensorFlow / Keras for GPU processing, and all DL/ML/AI to determine classification/clustering
Data visualization in matplotlib. Very advanced knowledge of customization is helpful (i.e. build your own Seaborn)
FRONT-END
Django web service at full scale. API centric to make front-ends quite naive and removing most logic from front-ends
We will hire a number of front-end engineers to build light-weight UIs in HTML/CSS/JS, mobile, APIs
Chatbots / NLP will be built to handle transaction ingestion, to further minimize the logic in front-ends
Educational Background Requirements
MSc/PhD required.

"Python Data Scientist - Research and Engineering
BACKGROUND
MAX Insurance is a 160-year-old Property & Casualty insurance company, that provides Home, Farm, Commercial, and Auto insurance. The company was acquired by Chelsea Avondale in 2016, with a plan to technologically modernize its operations and transform its pricing with advanced scientific methodologies.
Chelsea Avondale acquired Max Insurance in 2016. Chelsea Avondaleâ€™s team consists of former Canadian bank executives/industry veterans, that have a background in scientific computing and the development of full-scale production-level systems.
Skynet Software is a sister company to Max Insurance & Chelsea Avondale that employs the team of scientists, research & engineering, and systems development staff that serves the overall group.
The objective for Max Insurance since being acquired by Chelsea Avondale is to â€œwipe cleanâ€ all systems of the company, and â€œstart freshâ€ in the development of the Core Systems of an insurance company. This is a significant undertaking and a luxury most existing insurance companies don't have. The group is well underway in this process and is looking to add smart and brilliant physical and mathematical scientists, data and computer scientists to its team.
In practice, this complete redevelopment means the re-engineering of almost everything: every function and every interaction with the core systems of an insurance company. The Skynet Software team has been established to handle this responsibility.
The office is located in Kitchener, Ontario.
JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS
We are a Python Shop. You must know Python cold, and not as a simple recreational tool that you have experimented with. In addtion, you must know Pandas extraordinarily well: working with large datasets terabytes in size, developing customized functions, knowing how to speed up computation, etc.
The role involves much more than just Data Science. The development of our risk analytics ecosystem involves scientific modeling of natural hazards, curating risk data warehouses, systems engineering, data engineering, the development of DL/ML/AI middleware, and the guidance and oversight of front-end people. Less than 50% of this role involves data science. In particular, you must have a knack for building stochastic models for catastrophic events (e.g. wildfires, windstorm & climate, floods, etc.).
You are multi-talented with a deep intellectual curiosity. We are looking for scientific developers with a desire to immerse themselves in both software engineering, data science and mathematical modelling. The ideal candidate works quickly, independently and meticulously. You will have to think creatively to find the best solution for each problem in a limited time.
We are a NoSQL Shop.You must understand MongoDB or be able to learn it at an expert level quickly.
TensorFlow/Keras is a major asset.You have dealt with large numeric datasetsand can build fast analytics tools with the GPU. 10 million rows by 300 columns is a no-brainer for you.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN FROM US:
The insurance business: Policies/Coverages/Claims, risk analysis, advanced modelling, all core systems to run an insurance company.
Risk modelling: Catastrophes, probabilistic risk analysis, application of ML/DL to the insurance world, including the redevelopment of most Actuarial scientific methods.
Software Engineering: The design, development in Python, and deployment of an entire scientific software engineering project to run an entire insurance company. Being involved in the combination of a backend/middleware/front-end rooted in risk modelling with ML/DL.
Become a World Class Talent: You will work with Actuaries, Catastrophe Modeling experts, ML/DL specialists, and Software/Systems Engineers, and many leaders in the business. Depending on your skills, aptitude and leadership capabilities you will build a team or advance to executive roles.
Further information on our Ecosystem Stack:
BACKEND
MongoDB for NoSQL backend.
ELTs used for Aggregations/Layering/Transformations via Map/Reduce etc. to create Risk Data Warehouses as well as Transactional Data Structures (â€œData Warehouses or DWsâ€).
DWs will be stored in PyTables HDF5 files for highspeed. Eventually move to Hadoop based file structures. Understanding of the drag of dealing with large datasets will be essential.
Numerous APIs for external data sourcing, as well as static data ingestion through Geospatial KML files / SQL databases / JSON records.
MIDDLEWARE
Python Pandas / Dask is our primary framework for almost all engineering.
Use of â€œinternal APIsâ€ to create ecosystem modules and multiprocessing â€” > via PyZMQ
TensorFlow / Keras for GPU processing, and all DL/ML/AI to determine classification/clustering
Data visualization in matplotlib. Very advanced knowledge of customization is helpful (i.e. build your own Seaborn)
FRONT-END
Django web service at full scale. API centric to make front-ends quite naive and removing most logic from front-ends
We will hire a number of front-end engineers to build light-weight UIs in HTML/CSS/JS, mobile, APIs
Chatbots / NLP will be built to handle transaction ingestion, to further minimize the logic in front-ends
Educational Background Requirements
MSc/PhD required.

About BenchSci
We empower the world's scientists to run more successful experiments to accelerate drug discovery.
With a 50% failure rate, inappropriate antibodies waste millions of research dollars and delay novel therapies by months. BenchSciâ€™s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.
Here at BenchSci, these are our core values:
Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.
Advancement: We believe in continuous growth, and discovering new ways to do things better. This applies to our product and business, but also to ourselves.
Speed: We recognize that without a sense of urgency, our team, our product and our mission lose their value.
Tenacity: What weâ€™re trying to do isnâ€™t easy, but we hire the best people, and give them the autonomy, tools, and resources to succeed. The hard work is up to them.
Transparency: We believe that sharing diverse ideas and information creates strong teams. Our success stems from research, collaboration, feedback, and trust.
BenchSci is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment. All four of our cofounders are immigrants to Canada, as are many of our employees. We welcome your fresh perspectives and ideas."

"Clearbanc co-founders Michele Romanow and Andrew Dâ€™Souza knew there had to be a better way to fund your business than staking your house or sacrificing ownership of your company.
Michele and Andrew deeply understand the pains of building a business; Michele bootstrapped five companies, one which was acquired by Groupon, and sits on the other side of the table as a judge on â€œDragonâ€™s Den,â€ Canadaâ€™s equivalent of â€œShark Tank.â€ Andrew, meanwhile, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for multiple startups and is an investor and advisor to many others.
They've seen the broken funding process from all sides, and the idea for Clearbanc was inspired by their own experiences and struggles building companies and working with other entrepreneurs.
Clearbanc has invested in thousands of companies using data science to identify high-growth funding opportunities. This data-driven approach takes the bias out of decision making. Clearbanc has funded 8x more female founders than traditional VCs, and has invested in 43 states in the US in 2019.
Why work with us?
We're a company built by founders for founders, and weâ€™re laser-focused on our mission to help entrepreneurs succeed. You'll get the chance to work closely with people who have built, scaled and sold companies before.
While we're obsessed with our vision, we don't take ourselves too seriously. We donâ€™t know all the answers, so weâ€™re constantly experimenting and learning together.
Clearbanc is going through an exciting growth phase. Weâ€™ve just closed a $300M round and we're looking for the right people to join #TeamClearbanc. This is a unique opportunity for an ambitious person looking to make an impact while getting exposure to fintech and learning what it takes to build a successful startup.
The Data Team consists of Engineers and Scientists empowered to pursue Clearbanc's business objectives. We use Data Science and Machine Learning to provide data-driven solutions across the organization.
What your day-to-day will look like:
You will be assisting in conducting reproducible research that improves our business metrics while being constrained by tight deadlines
You will be using Statistics and Data Science to provide data-driven solutions across the organization
You will thrive if you:
Are able to write some SQL code (we don't expect you to be a DBA)
Can use the Python package Pandas for ETL (if you prefer)
Have exposure to reading data, and conducting basic summary analyses
Are familiar with common regression and classification algorithms
Have been exposed to things like the concept of statistical significance or variance in the context of making between-group comparisons
Are comfortable with using Git

About BenchSci
We empower the world's scientists to run more successful experiments to accelerate drug discovery.
With a 50% failure rate, inappropriate antibodies waste millions of research dollars and delay novel therapies by months. BenchSciâ€™s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.
Here at BenchSci, these are our core values:
Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.
Advancement: We believe in continuous growth, and discovering new ways to do things better. This applies to our product and business, but also to ourselves.
Speed: We recognize that without a sense of urgency, our team, our product and our mission lose their value.
Tenacity: What weâ€™re trying to do isnâ€™t easy, but we hire the best people, and give them the autonomy, tools, and resources to succeed. The hard work is up to them.
Transparency: We believe that sharing diverse ideas and information creates strong teams. Our success stems from research, collaboration, feedback, and trust.

"Python Data Scientist - Research and Engineering
BACKGROUND
MAX Insurance is a 160-year-old Property & Casualty insurance company, that provides Home, Farm, Commercial, and Auto insurance. The company was acquired by Chelsea Avondale in 2016, with a plan to technologically modernize its operations and transform its pricing with advanced scientific methodologies.
Chelsea Avondale acquired Max Insurance in 2016. Chelsea Avondaleâ€™s team consists of former Canadian bank executives/industry veterans, that have a background in scientific computing and the development of full-scale production-level systems.
Skynet Software is a sister company to Max Insurance & Chelsea Avondale that employs the team of scientists, research & engineering, and systems development staff that serves the overall group.
The objective for Max Insurance since being acquired by Chelsea Avondale is to â€œwipe cleanâ€ all systems of the company, and â€œstart freshâ€ in the development of the Core Systems of an insurance company. This is a significant undertaking and a luxury most existing insurance companies don't have. The group is well underway in this process and is looking to add smart and brilliant physical and mathematical scientists, data and computer scientists to its team.
In practice, this complete redevelopment means the re-engineering of almost everything: every function and every interaction with the core systems of an insurance company. The Skynet Software team has been established to handle this responsibility.
The office is located in Kitchener, Ontario.
JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS
We are a Python Shop. You must know Python cold, and not as a simple recreational tool that you have experimented with. In addtion, you must know Pandas extraordinarily well: working with large datasets terabytes in size, developing customized functions, knowing how to speed up computation, etc.
The role involves much more than just Data Science. The development of our risk analytics ecosystem involves scientific modeling of natural hazards, curating risk data warehouses, systems engineering, data engineering, the development of DL/ML/AI middleware, and the guidance and oversight of front-end people. Less than 50% of this role involves data science. In particular, you must have a knack for building stochastic models for catastrophic events (e.g. wildfires, windstorm & climate, floods, etc.).
You are multi-talented with a deep intellectual curiosity. We are looking for scientific developers with a desire to immerse themselves in both software engineering, data science and mathematical modelling. The ideal candidate works quickly, independently and meticulously. You will have to think creatively to find the best solution for each problem in a limited time.
We are a NoSQL Shop.You must understand MongoDB or be able to learn it at an expert level quickly.
TensorFlow/Keras is a major asset.You have dealt with large numeric datasetsand can build fast analytics tools with the GPU. 10 million rows by 300 columns is a no-brainer for you.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN FROM US:
The insurance business: Policies/Coverages/Claims, risk analysis, advanced modelling, all core systems to run an insurance company.
Risk modelling: Catastrophes, probabilistic risk analysis, application of ML/DL to the insurance world, including the redevelopment of most Actuarial scientific methods.
Software Engineering: The design, development in Python, and deployment of an entire scientific software engineering project to run an entire insurance company. Being involved in the combination of a backend/middleware/front-end rooted in risk modelling with ML/DL.
Become a World Class Talent: You will work with Actuaries, Catastrophe Modeling experts, ML/DL specialists, and Software/Systems Engineers, and many leaders in the business. Depending on your skills, aptitude and leadership capabilities you will build a team or advance to executive roles.
Further information on our Ecosystem Stack:
BACKEND
MongoDB for NoSQL backend.
ELTs used for Aggregations/Layering/Transformations via Map/Reduce etc. to create Risk Data Warehouses as well as Transactional Data Structures (â€œData Warehouses or DWsâ€).
DWs will be stored in PyTables HDF5 files for highspeed. Eventually move to Hadoop based file structures. Understanding of the drag of dealing with large datasets will be essential.
Numerous APIs for external data sourcing, as well as static data ingestion through Geospatial KML files / SQL databases / JSON records.
MIDDLEWARE
Python Pandas / Dask is our primary framework for almost all engineering.

This is truly an outstanding time.
Image recognition and speech recognition â€” GPU deep learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human imagination, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, Nvidiaâ€™s GPU runs deep learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and artificial intelligence come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why Nvidia GPUs are used broadly for deep learning, and Nvidia is increasingly known as â€œthe AI computing company.â€

"Python Data Scientist - Research and Engineering
BACKGROUND
MAX Insurance is a 160-year-old Property & Casualty insurance company, that provides Home, Farm, Commercial, and Auto insurance. The company was acquired by Chelsea Avondale in 2016, with a plan to technologically modernize its operations and transform its pricing with advanced scientific methodologies.
Chelsea Avondale acquired Max Insurance in 2016. Chelsea Avondaleâ€™s team consists of former Canadian bank executives/industry veterans, that have a background in scientific computing and the development of full-scale production-level systems.
Skynet Software is a sister company to Max Insurance & Chelsea Avondale that employs the team of scientists, research & engineering, and systems development staff that serves the overall group.
The objective for Max Insurance since being acquired by Chelsea Avondale is to â€œwipe cleanâ€ all systems of the company, and â€œstart freshâ€ in the development of the Core Systems of an insurance company. This is a significant undertaking and a luxury most existing insurance companies don't have. The group is well underway in this process and is looking to add smart and brilliant physical and mathematical scientists, data and computer scientists to its team.
In practice, this complete redevelopment means the re-engineering of almost everything: every function and every interaction with the core systems of an insurance company. The Skynet Software team has been established to handle this responsibility.
The office is located in Kitchener, Ontario.
JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS
We are a Python Shop. You must know Python cold, and not as a simple recreational tool that you have experimented with. In addtion, you must know Pandas extraordinarily well: working with large datasets terabytes in size, developing customized functions, knowing how to speed up computation, etc.
The role involves much more than just Data Science. The development of our risk analytics ecosystem involves scientific modeling of natural hazards, curating risk data warehouses, systems engineering, data engineering, the development of DL/ML/AI middleware, and the guidance and oversight of front-end people. Less than 50% of this role involves data science. In particular, you must have a knack for building stochastic models for catastrophic events (e.g. wildfires, windstorm & climate, floods, etc.).
You are multi-talented with a deep intellectual curiosity. We are looking for scientific developers with a desire to immerse themselves in both software engineering, data science and mathematical modelling. The ideal candidate works quickly, independently and meticulously. You will have to think creatively to find the best solution for each problem in a limited time.
We are a NoSQL Shop.You must understand MongoDB or be able to learn it at an expert level quickly.
TensorFlow/Keras is a major asset.You have dealt with large numeric datasetsand can build fast analytics tools with the GPU. 10 million rows by 300 columns is a no-brainer for you.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN FROM US:
The insurance business: Policies/Coverages/Claims, risk analysis, advanced modelling, all core systems to run an insurance company.
Risk modelling: Catastrophes, probabilistic risk analysis, application of ML/DL to the insurance world, including the redevelopment of most Actuarial scientific methods.
Software Engineering: The design, development in Python, and deployment of an entire scientific software engineering project to run an entire insurance company. Being involved in the combination of a backend/middleware/front-end rooted in risk modelling with ML/DL.
Become a World Class Talent: You will work with Actuaries, Catastrophe Modeling experts, ML/DL specialists, and Software/Systems Engineers, and many leaders in the business. Depending on your skills, aptitude and leadership capabilities you will build a team or advance to executive roles.
Further information on our Ecosystem Stack:
BACKEND
MongoDB for NoSQL backend.
ELTs used for Aggregations/Layering/Transformations via Map/Reduce etc. to create Risk Data Warehouses as well as Transactional Data Structures (â€œData Warehouses or DWsâ€).
DWs will be stored in PyTables HDF5 files for highspeed. Eventually move to Hadoop based file structures. Understanding of the drag of dealing with large datasets will be essential.
Numerous APIs for external data sourcing, as well as static data ingestion through Geospatial KML files / SQL databases / JSON records.
MIDDLEWARE
Python Pandas / Dask is our primary framework for almost all engineering.
Use of â€œinternal APIsâ€ to create ecosystem modules and multiprocessing â€” > via PyZMQ
TensorFlow / Keras for GPU processing, and all DL/ML/AI to determine classification/clustering
Data visualization in matplotlib. Very advanced knowledge of customization is helpful (i.e. build your own Seaborn)
FRONT-END
Django web service at full scale. API centric to make front-ends quite naive and removing most logic from front-ends
We will hire a number of front-end engineers to build light-weight UIs in HTML/CSS/JS, mobile, APIs
Chatbots / NLP will be built to handle transaction ingestion, to further minimize the logic in front-ends
Educational Background Requirements
MSc/PhD required.

"This company is an e-retailer with a unique method for collecting books. It combined this strategy with the development of simple software that only analyzes current market information. This has created efficiencies in the pricing and processing of books. We are looking to build off of this initial software by starting Price Point. Its goal is to create predictive pricing models using historical data and machine learning. Additionally, once the item is â€œliveâ€ there is a need to keep the listing competitive in a dynamic marketplace. We hope to apply this new technology to our current operations and to initially market it as a pricing engine for third-party sellers on Amazon.

"Python Data Scientist - Research and Engineering
BACKGROUND
MAX Insurance is a 160-year-old Property & Casualty insurance company, that provides Home, Farm, Commercial, and Auto insurance. The company was acquired by Chelsea Avondale in 2016, with a plan to technologically modernize its operations and transform its pricing with advanced scientific methodologies.
Chelsea Avondale acquired Max Insurance in 2016. Chelsea Avondaleâ€™s team consists of former Canadian bank executives/industry veterans, that have a background in scientific computing and the development of full-scale production-level systems.
Skynet Software is a sister company to Max Insurance & Chelsea Avondale that employs the team of scientists, research & engineering, and systems development staff that serves the overall group.
The objective for Max Insurance since being acquired by Chelsea Avondale is to â€œwipe cleanâ€ all systems of the company, and â€œstart freshâ€ in the development of the Core Systems of an insurance company. This is a significant undertaking and a luxury most existing insurance companies don't have. The group is well underway in this process and is looking to add smart and brilliant physical and mathematical scientists, data and computer scientists to its team.
In practice, this complete redevelopment means the re-engineering of almost everything: every function and every interaction with the core systems of an insurance company. The Skynet Software team has been established to handle this responsibility.
The office is located in Kitchener, Ontario.
JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS
We are a Python Shop. You must know Python cold, and not as a simple recreational tool that you have experimented with. In addtion, you must know Pandas extraordinarily well: working with large datasets terabytes in size, developing customized functions, knowing how to speed up computation, etc.
The role involves much more than just Data Science. The development of our risk analytics ecosystem involves scientific modeling of natural hazards, curating risk data warehouses, systems engineering, data engineering, the development of DL/ML/AI middleware, and the guidance and oversight of front-end people. Less than 50% of this role involves data science. In particular, you must have a knack for building stochastic models for catastrophic events (e.g. wildfires, windstorm & climate, floods, etc.).
You are multi-talented with a deep intellectual curiosity. We are looking for scientific developers with a desire to immerse themselves in both software engineering, data science and mathematical modelling. The ideal candidate works quickly, independently and meticulously. You will have to think creatively to find the best solution for each problem in a limited time.
We are a NoSQL Shop.You must understand MongoDB or be able to learn it at an expert level quickly.
TensorFlow/Keras is a major asset.You have dealt with large numeric datasetsand can build fast analytics tools with the GPU. 10 million rows by 300 columns is a no-brainer for you.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN FROM US:
The insurance business: Policies/Coverages/Claims, risk analysis, advanced modelling, all core systems to run an insurance company.
Risk modelling: Catastrophes, probabilistic risk analysis, application of ML/DL to the insurance world, including the redevelopment of most Actuarial scientific methods.
Software Engineering: The design, development in Python, and deployment of an entire scientific software engineering project to run an entire insurance company. Being involved in the combination of a backend/middleware/front-end rooted in risk modelling with ML/DL.
Become a World Class Talent: You will work with Actuaries, Catastrophe Modeling experts, ML/DL specialists, and Software/Systems Engineers, and many leaders in the business. Depending on your skills, aptitude and leadership capabilities you will build a team or advance to executive roles.
Further information on our Ecosystem Stack:
BACKEND
MongoDB for NoSQL backend.
ELTs used for Aggregations/Layering/Transformations via Map/Reduce etc. to create Risk Data Warehouses as well as Transactional Data Structures (â€œData Warehouses or DWsâ€).
DWs will be stored in PyTables HDF5 files for highspeed. Eventually move to Hadoop based file structures. Understanding of the drag of dealing with large datasets will be essential.
Numerous APIs for external data sourcing, as well as static data ingestion through Geospatial KML files / SQL databases / JSON records.
MIDDLEWARE
Python Pandas / Dask is our primary framework for almost all engineering.
Use of â€œinternal APIsâ€ to create ecosystem modules and multiprocessing â€” > via PyZMQ
TensorFlow / Keras for GPU processing, and all DL/ML/AI to determine classification/clustering
Data visualization in matplotlib. Very advanced knowledge of customization is helpful (i.e. build your own Seaborn)
FRONT-END
Django web service at full scale. API centric to make front-ends quite naive and removing most logic from front-ends
We will hire a number of front-end engineers to build light-weight UIs in HTML/CSS/JS, mobile, APIs
Chatbots / NLP will be built to handle transaction ingestion, to further minimize the logic in front-ends

"This company is an e-retailer with a unique method for collecting books. It combined this strategy with the development of simple software that only analyzes current market information. This has created efficiencies in the pricing and processing of books. We are looking to build off of this initial software by starting Price Point. Its goal is to create predictive pricing models using historical data and machine learning. Additionally, once the item is â€œliveâ€ there is a need to keep the listing competitive in a dynamic marketplace. We hope to apply this new technology to our current operations and to initially market it as a pricing engine for third-party sellers on Amazon.
